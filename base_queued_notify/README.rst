This module is a base that allows you to schedule future notifications
on a record when it reaches certain state.

You will be able to configure the model, notification type (email, log
note, activity) and delay time.

For example: create a reminder activity on a sales order one day after
it is confirmed without having the customer reference filled in.

Usage

You can not use this module on its own.

You need to install a especification module or create your own one.

See the queued_purchase_notify module from sy_purchase_workflow
repository ax an example of implementation.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

For time issues, this module has not been completed perfectly. The
following improvements are proposed:

-  Combine all tha activity types (mail, note, activity) on the same
   model. Create a menu to access all of them. On the form view, the
   user should only be able to acess the activity type fields.

-  Let the user configure notifications from user interface, like
   automatic activities. The user should be able to set up an activity
   selecting its model and its trigger domain.

-  Create an absctract unit test class in this module.
