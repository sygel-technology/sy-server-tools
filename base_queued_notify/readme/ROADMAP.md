For time issues, this module has not been completed perfectly. The following improvements are proposed:

- Combine all tha activity types (mail, note, activity) on the same model. Create a menu to access all of them. On the form view, the user should only be able to acess the activity type fields.

- Let the user configure notifications from user interface, like automatic activities. The user should be able to set up an activity selecting its model and its trigger domain.

- Create an absctract unit test class in this module.
