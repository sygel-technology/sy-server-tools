Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

-  Go to Settings / General Settings / Companies, and click on the
   'Configure Document Layout' button
-  You can the text size, text size unit, header size, and header size
   unit
-  If you activate the debug mode, you can manually change the css of
   all reports. Only recomended for developers

Usage
=====

To use this module, print a report after changing the configuration. The
font size will be your configured one.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

If a report uses special custom classes, the font size cannot be
changed. It is not common, but it has been detected that it happens with
the direction of boxed reports. It can also happen if a report uses
headers other than h2. If this happens to you, tell the technician who
creates CSS for you. Example to solve the size of headers 1, and the
direction of the boxed:

font-size: 20px; h1 { font-size: 40px; } .o_boxed_header { font-size:
20px; }

Migrations between v15 y v18 should de fast and easy.

More css units can be added.
